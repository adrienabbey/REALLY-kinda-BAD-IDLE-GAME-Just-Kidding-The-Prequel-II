# REALLY (kinda) BAD IDLE GAME (Just Kidding) The Prequel II

> Or RKBIGJKTP2 for short

## TO-DO

1. ~~Submit Team names~~
2. ~~Make Github Repo and have everyone clone~~
3. ~~Pick a “theme”.  Suggestion: try Kingdom of Loathing for thematic ideas.~~
4. ~~Decide on complexity.  Suggestion: look at Progress Quest for a very “simple” start.~~
5. ~~Use this to replace the google docs version? or maybe just use google docs form as our purposely terrible format goofy thing for presentation.~~
6. Implement everything in the [Minimal Viable Product](./MVP.md) documentation.

## Ideas to be expanded

* The player's idle progress could be calculated by tracking their starting time, active Jobs, and end time. When they start again we track the time and calculate what would have been gained.
* Exploration of the human condition.
  * The player is *the disclaimer window*.  This isn't obvious at first.
  * Start with no equipment.  Discover later that you're like characters from the Wizard of Oz, looking to find intellect, courage, and such.  And the best way to do that is to gather the best organs from slain enemies and equip them.

## Topics to be Researched

* Save files?
  * Probably reasonable to just implement a basic method to save/load Java objects.

## Features to be implemented

* See the [Minimal Viable Product](./MVP.md) documentation

## STRETCH Goals

* 2nd Mode(Interactive)
* Party of character
* Server, Web Interface
* Friends, Parties
* Live dungeon feature
* Thesaurus feature
* Presentation mode
* Downgrades
  * Debt Traps
* Scripted Events
* Art Mode
* Cheat Codes
* Unreal Engine full-screen loading screen, but only for the main menu, complete with animations, music and sound.
 * Clicking start or load immediately closes the Unreal Engine part and immediately starts opening janky Java Swing windows.
